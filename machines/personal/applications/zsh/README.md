## Installation

I use the [Oh My Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/) framework as the foundation of my Zsh setup, with a few tweaks to match my personal aesthetic. For the theme, I use the [cloud](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/blob/master/themes/cloud.zsh-theme) theme that comes with Oh My Zsh. I've also added a few plugins to enhance my workflow, such as `git`, and `node`.

To install my zshrc setup, simply run this script:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stellaOnEstrogen/dotfiles/main/machines/personal/scripts/install_zsh.sh | bash
```
