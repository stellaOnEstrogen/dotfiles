## Installation

To install my i3 configuration, simply clone my dotfiles repository and copy the i3 configuration file to your i3 config directory:

cp dotfiles/machines/personal/applications/i3/config ~/.config/i3/config
```

## Keybindings

Here's a list of some keybindings I use in my i3 setup:

- `$mod+Return` to open the terminal
- `$mod+d` to open rofi
- `$mod+i` to open GNOME Image Viewer
- `$mod+Shift+q` to kill the focused window
- `$mod+1` to `$mod+0` to switch to workspaces 1 to 10
- `$mod+Shift+1` to `$mod+Shift+0` to move the focused container to workspaces 1 to 10

For a full list of keybindings, refer to the [config file](./config).
