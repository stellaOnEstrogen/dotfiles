## Installation

I use the [Catppuccin-GTK-Theme](https://github.com/Fausto-Korpsvart/Catppuccin-GTK-Theme) as the foundation of my theme, with a few tweaks to match my personal aesthetic. For icons, I stick with the clean and classic [Adwaita](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gtk/-/tree/master/gtk/theme/Adwaita) icon theme.

To install my theme setup, simply run this script:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stellaOnEstrogen/dotfiles/main/machines/personal/scripts/install_theme.sh | sudo bash
```

## Extensions

Here are the GNOME extensions that elevate my desktop experience:

- **[Just Perfection](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/3843/just-perfection/)** — Tune your GNOME shell to perfection with customizable options.
- **[User Themes](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/19/user-themes/)** — Easily manage and switch between GNOME themes.
- **[Vitals](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/1460/vitals/)** — Keep track of your system stats right from your panel.

## Key Changes

I’ve made several key adjustments to tailor GNOME to my style:

- **Unique Panel:** Updated the panel's background and font colors for a fresh and modern look.
- **Compact Panel:** Reduced the height and width for a sleeker feel.
- **Centered Panel:** Adjusted margins and width to perfectly center the panel.
- **Responsive Design:** Limited panel width on larger screens for better responsiveness.
- **Interactive Panel:** Added a smooth hover effect to make interactions more enjoyable.
