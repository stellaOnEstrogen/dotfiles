<h1 align="center">dotfiles</h1>

This repository contains my personal dotfiles and configurations for various tools and applications. The configurations are organized by machine and application. Each machine has its own directory containing the configurations for the applications installed on that machine. The configurations for each application are stored in a directory named after the application. The configurations are organized by file type and purpose. The `README.md` file in each directory contains information about the configurations for that application.
